# ApiAcceptance

This is collection of interacting componets facilitating the creation and execution of automated test and create the result reports.

This framework has multiple layer and it loosely coupled to each other. It provides very good reporting, error handling and environment configuration, so that we can spend more time on createing test cases insted of the reporting and environment configuration setup. And this framework support various different data structures such as JSON, XML and even plain text and also supports parsing mechanism for JSON and XML. Basic validation like verifying API response code is very easy.
